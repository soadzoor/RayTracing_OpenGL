# Raytracing
## This project is a realtime raytracing application, using the openGL library.

##How to run
0. You need Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, or later
1. Download the project
2. Extract the *OGLPack_VS2015.zip* file to a folder, for example your C:\ drive.
3. Make a virtual drive of the folder where you extracted the zip. For example, if you extracted to *C:\*, then you should have a folder *OGLPack*. You can access it at *C:\OGLPack*, so you need to make C:\ a virtual drive called *T:\*. The simplest method is to open the windows command line (search for *cmd*) and type: *subst t: c:\*
4. You can open up the project and press *Build and run*. On Visual Studio 2015, you may need some extra steps to compile the project successfully, I only tested it on VS2013 Ultimate.
